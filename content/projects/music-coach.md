MusiCoach is a smart musical composition assistant destined towards beginners. It contains a dashboard with an MIDI editor/reader but can also listen to someone play at the piano and retranscribe the notes in the app. The assistant helps the user compose by suggesting some phrases, melodies, sequences of notes coherent to the patterns created by the user according to the style and progression of the musical piece.

The user, using his computer, composes the beginning to a melodie in a MIDI editor, the smart assistant then suggests a multitude of choices to complete his music. Finally, the user chooses the number of notes that he wishes the assistant to predict with the help of a slider, and adds the suggestion he prefers to his musical piece.
